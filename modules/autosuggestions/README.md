# ZSH Autosuggestions

This plugin enables [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/tarruda/zsh-autosuggestions) and adds
vi-mode compatible keybindings.

## Keybindings

* `CTRL-F` is bound to `vi-forward-word`, it is equivalent to hitting `w` in vim and accepts the
  suggestion word by word
* `CTRL-K` is bound to `vi-end-of-line` which effectively accepts the suggestion
