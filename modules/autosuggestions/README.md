# Autosuggestions

Integrates [zsh-autosuggestions][1] into Prezto, which implements the
[Fish shell][2]'s autosuggestions feature, where the user can type in any part
of a previously entered command and Zsh suggests commands as you type based on
history and completions.

If this module is used in conjunction with the [_`syntax-highlighting`_][3]
module, this module must be loaded _after_ the _`syntax-highlighting`_ module.

If this module is used in conjunction with the [_`history-substring-search`_][4]
module, this module must be loaded _after_ the _`history-substring-search`_
module.

To elaborate, the relative order of loading the modules would be
_`autosuggestions`_, _`syntax-highlighting`_ and _`history-substring-search`_.

## Contributors

New features and bug fixes should be submitted to the [zsh-autosuggestions][1]
project according to its rules and regulations. This module will be synchronized
against it.

## Settings

### Highlighting

If colors are enabled, _autosuggestions_ will automatically highlight
positive results.

To enable highlighting for this module only, add the following line to
_`${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.zpreztorc`_:

```sh
zstyle ':prezto:module:autosuggestions' color 'yes'
```

To set the query found color, add the following line to
_`${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.zpreztorc`_:

```sh
zstyle ':prezto:module:autosuggestions:color' found ''
```

## Troubleshooting

### Autosuggestions from previous sessions don't show up

For autosuggestions from previous shell sessions to work, please make sure you
also have the `history` module enabled.
