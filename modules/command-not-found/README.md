Command-Not-Found
=================

Displays installation information for not found commands by loading the
[command-not-found][1] tool on Debian-based and Arch Linux-based distributions.

For users of Mac OS X, if homebrew and [homebrew-command-not-found][2] are properly installed, this module will provide similar information as is presented to Linux users.

For example... (on OSX with Homebrew)

```bash
$ when
The program 'when' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing:
  brew install when
```
