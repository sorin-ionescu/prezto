Command-Not-Found
=================

When you try to use a command that is not available locally, searches
the package manager for a package offering that command and suggests
the proper install command.

Debian and Arch Linux based distributions use the [`command-not-found`][1] tool.

macOS uses Homebrew's [`command-not-found` clone][2]. Note that you also need to
[follow the instructions][3] to tap the `command-not-found` homebrew repository.
