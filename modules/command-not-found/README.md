# Command-Not-Found

When you try to use a command that is not available locally, searches the
package manager for a package offering that command and suggests the proper
install command.

Debian and Arch Linux based distributions use the [`command-not-found`][1] tool.

macOS uses Homebrew's [`command-not-found` clone][2]. Note that unless you have
a recent version of Homebrew installed, you might also need to tap the
`command-not-found` Homebrew repository [following the instructions][3].
