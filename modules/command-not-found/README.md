Command-Not-Found
=================

When you try to use a command that is not available locally, searches
the package manager for a package offering that command and suggests
the proper install command. 

Debian-based and Arch Linux-based distributions use the [`command-not-found`][1] tool.

macOS uses Homebrew's [`command-not-found` clone][2]. Note that you also need to [follow the instructions to tap the `command-not-found` homebrew repository][3].
