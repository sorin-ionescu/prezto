per-directory-history
=====================

By using ^G you can toggle from 'global' and 'per-directory' modes of your history mode, this means that only the commands played on a specific directory will appear in your history when 'per-directory' mode, or normal behaviour when you switch to the other one

In order to use this plugin it must be enabled after "editor" plugin

This plugin is borrowed from oh-my-zsh
