`nvm` Auto Use
==============

This module integrates [`nvm` auto use][1] shell integration into Prezto. It will automatically call `nvm use` in a directory with a .nvmrc file. This recipe is **not** supported by the `nvm` development team, but they are accepting pull requests for more examples.

This module must be loaded **after** the [node](../node) module.
