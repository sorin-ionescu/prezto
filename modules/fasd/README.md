# Fasd

[Fasd][1] is a command-line productivity booster, inspired by tools like
[autojump][2], [z][3] and [v][4], it offers quick access to files and
directories by keeping track of files and directories that were previously
accessed.

For shell completion to work, this module must be loaded _after_ the
[_`completion`_][5] module.

The Prezto Fasd configuration differs from the default. The default aliases have
been disabled.

## Installation

`fasd` is bundled with prezto as a git submodule. Alternatively, you can
manually install `fasd`. If a manual installation is found, it will be used
instead of the bundled version.

## Aliases

- `j` changes the current working directory interactively.

## Completion

Type `,`, `f,`, `d,` in front of a comma-separated query or type `,,`, `,,f`,
`,,d` at the end of a comma-separated query then hit <kbd>TAB</kbd>.
