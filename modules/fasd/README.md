FASD
====

[Fasd][1] is a command-line productivity booster. Fasd offers quick access to
files and directories. It is inspired by tools like [autojump][2], [z][3] and
[v][4]. Fasd keeps track of files and directories you have accessed, so that
you can quickly reference them in the command line.

You should define your own aliases to utilize the full power of fasd. For more
information please see `man fasd` or visit [fasd][1].
