Completion
==========
Load additional completion files not built in *zsh* but provided by the
[zsh-completions][1] project.

Note to the developers
----------------------
No modules should only add a completion file; if you feel like your completion
file is important, contribute to the [zsh-completions][1] project directly.

This module will be updated regularly to provide all possible completions.

Authors
-------
*The authors of this module should be contacted via the github bug tracker.*
