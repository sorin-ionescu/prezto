Prezto â€” Instantly Awesome Zsh
==============================

Prezto is the configuration framework for [Zsh][1]; it enriches the command line
interface environment with sane defaults, aliases, functions, auto completion,
and prompt themes.

Installation
------------

Prezto will work with any recent release of Zsh, but the minimum recommended
version is 4.3.10.

  1. Launch Zsh:

        zsh

  2. Clone the repository:

        git clone --recursive https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto.git "${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.zprezto"

  3. Create a new Zsh configuration by copying the Zsh configuration files
     provided:

        setopt EXTENDED_GLOB
        for rcfile in "${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}"/.zprezto/runcoms/^README.md(.N); do
          ln -s "$rcfile" "${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.${rcfile:t}"
        done

  4. Set Zsh as your default shell:

        chsh -s /bin/zsh

  5. Open a new Zsh terminal window or tab.

### Mac OS X

If you have administrator privileges, you must fix an Apple-introduced problem
in Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard by executing the following command, or BASH and Zsh
will have the wrong `PATH` when executed non-interactively.

    sudo chmod ugo-x /usr/libexec/path_helper

`path_helper` is intended to make it easier for installers to add new paths to
the environment without having to edit shell configuration files by adding
a file with a path to the */etc/paths.d* directory.

Unfortunately, `path_helper` always reads paths from */etc/paths* set by Apple
then paths from */etc/paths.d* set by third party installers, and lastly paths
from the `PATH` environment variable set by the parent process, which
ultimately is set by the user with `export PATH=...` Thus, it reorders path
priorities, and user */bin* directories meant to override system */bin*
directories end up at the tail of the array.

### Troubleshooting

If you are not able to find certain commands after switching to *Prezto*,
modify the `PATH` variable in *~/.zshenv* then open a new Zsh terminal
window or tab.

Usage
-----

Prezto has many features disabled by default. Read the source code and
accompanying README files to learn of what is available.

### Modules

  1. Browse */modules* to see what is available.
  2. Load the modules you need in *~/.zpreztorc* then open a new Zsh terminal
     window or tab.

### Themes

  1. For a list of themes, type `prompt -l`.
  2. To preview a theme, type `prompt -p name`.
  3. Load the theme you like in *~/.zpreztorc* then open a new Zsh terminal
     window or tab.
